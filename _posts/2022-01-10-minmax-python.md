> Minimax is a type of adversarial search algorithm for generating and exploring game trees. It is mostly used to solve zero-sum games  where one side’s gain is equivalent to other side’s loss, so adding all gains and subtracting all losses end up being zero.

This Adversarial search behaves differently compared to other conventional searching algorithms. This is done by adding opponents into the mix. Minimax algorithm keeps playing the turns of both player and the opponent optimally to figure out the best possible move.
